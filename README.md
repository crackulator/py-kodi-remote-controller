=========================

XBMC remote controller written in Python

Just a fun small project to explore JSON, TCP requests, and play with my favorite HTPC, XBMC.

Well, sometimes I feel bored to seek the TV remote or to launch [Yatse][4] on my phone when coding. With this Python script I can now control XBMC directly from a terminal. Life is good.

Note: a couple of methods are currently covered (see Contributions)

## Quick start

Clone this repo and from the folder, launch the script:

```
python pycontroller.py
```

Use the help command to have the list of available methods, and help + command to display a usage message.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome and easy. Every methods of the API can be included, only a few are done today. The structure of the program makes this method by method implementation obvious.

In any doubt, I will be pleased to discuss with you.

## Developped commands

### Audio library
```audio_library_get_albums``` - display list of 20 albums from a given ID
```audio_library_scan``` - start a scan of the audio library
 
### GUI
```gui_show_notification``` - display a notification on the screen with the text sent as a paramater

### JSON
```json_version``` - display the JSON version of the XBMC server

### player
```player_get_actives``` - display the active players (audio, video and picture)

### system
```system_reboot``` - reboot the XBMC server
