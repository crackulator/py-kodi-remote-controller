=========================

XBMC remote controller written in Python

Just a fun small project to explore JSON, TCP requests, and play with my favorite HTPC, XBMC.

Well, sometimes I feel bored to seek the TV remote or to launch [Yatse][4] on my phone when coding. With this Python script I can now control XBMC directly from a terminal. Life is good.

Note: a couple of methods are currently covered (see Contributions)

## Quick start

Clone this repo and from the folder, launch the script:

```
python pycontroller.py
```

Use the help command to have the list of available methods, and help + command to display a usage message.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome and easy. Every methods of the API can be included, only a few are done today. The structure of the program makes this method by method implementation obvious.

In any doubt, I will be pleased to discuss with you.
